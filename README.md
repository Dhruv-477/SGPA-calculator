# SGPA Calculator

A comprehensive C# console application for calculating **SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average)** and **CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)** for students.

## Features

- üìä **SGPA Calculation**: Calculate grade point average for individual semesters
- üìà **CGPA Calculation**: Calculate cumulative grade point average across multiple semesters
- ‚úÖ **Input Validation**: Robust validation for grade points (0-10), credit hours, and subject names
- üíª **Interactive Console Interface**: User-friendly command-line interface
- üìù **Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive summary reports with semester-wise breakdown
- üß™ **Built-in Tests**: Automated tests to verify calculation accuracy

## How SGPA and CGPA Work

### SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average)
```
SGPA = Œ£(Grade Point √ó Credit Hours) / Œ£(Credit Hours)
```
Calculated for a single semester using all subjects in that semester.

### CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)
```
CGPA = Œ£(Grade Point √ó Credit Hours for all semesters) / Œ£(Credit Hours for all semesters)
```
Calculated across all semesters to give an overall academic performance measure.

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Navigate** to the SGPACalculator directory
3. **Build** the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

## Key Classes

### Subject
- Represents a single subject with name, grade point (0-10), and credit hours
- Validates input parameters
- Calculates weighted grade points

### Semester
- Contains multiple subjects for a specific semester
- Calculates total credit hours and weighted grade points
- Computes SGPA for the semester

### Student
- Manages multiple semesters for a student
- Calculates overall CGPA across all semesters
- Provides detailed academic summary reports

## Input Validation

- **Grade Points**: Must be between 0.0 and 10.0
- **Credit Hours**: Must be positive integers
- **Subject Names**: Cannot be empty or whitespace
- **Semester Numbers**: Must be positive integers

## Requirements

- **.NET 8.0** or later
- **Windows, macOS, or Linux**

## Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd SGPA-calculator/SGPACalculator

# Build the application
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run

# Run tests
dotnet run test
```

## Example Calculations

### SGPA Example
For a semester with:
- Mathematics: 9.0 GP √ó 4 CH = 36.0
- Physics: 8.5 GP √ó 3 CH = 25.5
- Programming: 9.5 GP √ó 4 CH = 38.0

SGPA = (36.0 + 25.5 + 38.0) √∑ (4 + 3 + 4) = 99.5 √∑ 11 = **9.05**

### CGPA Example
Across 2 semesters:
- Semester 1: 99.5 weighted GP, 11 credits
- Semester 2: 85.0 weighted GP, 10 credits

CGPA = (99.5 + 85.0) √∑ (11 + 10) = 184.5 √∑ 21 = **8.79**
